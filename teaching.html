            <h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
<p>As a future teacher, I am committed to creating engaging and supportive classrooms where students feel inspired to explore, design, and innovate.</p>
<p>I believe that learning should be inclusive and accessible, providing every student with the opportunity to succeed and develop confidence in their abilities. My goal is to combine practical, hands-on projects with critical thinking so that students can see the real-world value of their learning.</p>
<p>Through exploring materials, technologies, and creative processes, I want to nurture curiosity, problem-solving, and resilience in my students. I aim to guide them in becoming independent learners who can adapt their skills to a constantly changing world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I aspire to empower students to see themselves as capable designers and innovators who can make a meaningful impact on their communities and beyond.</p>

    <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Across my placements, I have taken pride in developing lessons that are practical, creative, and responsive to the needs of different learners and school contexts. I seek out opportunities to make Industrial Technology, Food Technologies, Design and Technology, and Textiles engaging by connecting classroom projects to real-world applications. From guiding students through timber projects that move from initial sketches to final products, to teaching essential food preparation skills, I aim to ensure learning is hands-on, relevant, and motivating. These experiences have allowed me to refine my ability to plan, deliver, and reflect on lessons that not only build technical competence but also nurture student confidence and a genuine enthusiasm for learning.</p>

    <h2> <em>My Favourite Educational Quote</em></h2>
    <!--This is the quote I designed in canva-->
    <p>One of my favourite quotes is by Tom Bodett: “School teaches you lessons and then gives you a test. Life gives you a test that teaches you lessons.” I connect with this deeply because it reminds me that true learning doesn’t stop at the classroom door—it continues through challenges, mistakes, and real-world experiences. For me, this reinforces the importance of preparing students not just with knowledge, but with the resilience and adaptability to face whatever life puts in front of them. I want my students to leave my classes with confidence in their skills, an ability to reflect and grow from challenges, and a genuine sense that their learning belongs to them beyond school.</p>
