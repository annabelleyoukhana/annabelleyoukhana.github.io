    <h3>Stage 6 Design & Technology </h3>
<p>All students completing the <strong>Stage 6 Design and Technology </strong> course must produce a Management Folio that documents their design process and production journey for the HSC Major Project.</p>

<p>The folio includes elements such as the <em>design brief, research, resource planning, prototyping, evaluation</em>, and <em>final reflection</em>. It provides evidence of critical thinking, problem-solving, and project management skills â€” all of which are essential to meeting NESA requirements.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a completed folio document for reference. This example showcases how students can structure and present their design process in a professional format:</p>
